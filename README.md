# Hello, Python!
This is my repository of Python scripts. I'm trying to get into the Coding Wonderland. The objective of this endevour is because I love bioinformatics and programming skills are really important to become a good bioinformatician.

I'm using the book [Python for Biologists](http://pythonforbiologists.com/index.php/books/) and some web pages as a guide in this adventure:
