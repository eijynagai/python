# Hello, Python!
This is my personal repository of Python scripts. The goal is to practice and
have fun with Python.

Some interesting projects:

* Machine-learning with scikit-learn (`irisflower.py`)
In this section, I use the library scikit-learn for `classification model` 
with the popular `iris` dataset.
