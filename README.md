# Hello, Python!
This is my repository of Python scripts. I'm trying to get into the Coding Wonderland. The objective of this endevour is because I love bioinformatics and programming skills are really important to become a good bioinformatician.

# Machine-learning with scikit-learn
In this section I also have some scripts using the library scikit-learn for studying machine learning in Python. By now, I am studying `classification model` through some simple examples.

### Classification Model
Inside machine-learning, we can separate learning problems in two big categories: supervised and unsupervised methods. Unsupervised learning aims to make clusters within the data, which is a vector without corresponding target values. Despite that, supervised learning is based on labeled data and how to predict the class of a unlabeled data. (1)Classification modeling aims to give a label to a new imput vector. (2)Regression try to predict future values based on the patterns found in the training data.
